# Introduction

Def entity as a set $V = \{V_1, \dots, V_N\}$

Def Neuron, aka computing elements, as a set $N = \{n_1,\dots, n_k\}$


Def **Local Representation**: $n_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots, k\}$, can be represented by $V_j$, for  $j\in \{1,\dots, N\}$. 

Def **Distributed Representation**: $n_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots, k\}$, can be represented by $V_o \subset V$

| | Local Representation|Distributed Representation |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Pros | Intuitive: Structure similar to knowledge  | Efficient|
| Cons | Hard to express componential structure  | Hard to store a large set of arbitary associations|
