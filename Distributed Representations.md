# Introduction

Def Neuron, aka computing elements, as a set $V = \{V_1, \dots, V_N\}$

Def Entity , as a set $N = \{n_1,\dots, n_k\}$


Def **Local Representation**: $n_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots, k\}$, can be represented by $V_j$, for  $j\in \{1,\dots, N\}$. 

Def **Distributed Representation**: $n_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots, k\}$, can be represented by $V_o \subset V$

| | Local Representation|Distributed Representation |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Pros | Intuitive: Structure similar to knowledge  | Efficient|
| Cons | Hard to express componential structure  | Hard to store a large set of arbitary associations|

# Virtues of Distributed System
## Constructive Character(Memory as Inference)
Content-Addressable memory vs Tradition computer memory
1. Error correction | Use adress to retrieve information
2. Pattern which are not active does not exist | Patterns always exist

Other prospect to see distributed representation- Inferrence rules:

Each computing unit is 'microfeature'. The connection strength is 'microinferences'.

Def a stable pattern of acitvity is one that satisfies the microinferences less than its neighbor patterns.

Def A genuine memory/veridical recall is a pattern that is stable because the connection strenth were modified before this pattern occured.

Def A confabulation/plausible reconstruction is a pattern that is stable because the connection strength have been modified by several previous patterns but not the partern itself.
